Welcome to the codebase for "Privileged Sensing Scaffolds Reinforcement Learning". Here, you will find:

* Scaffolder, a model-based RL method that uses privileged observations to better train policies.
* Sensory Scaffolding Suite (S3), a privileged POMDP benchmark of 10 diverse tasks containing locomotion, dexterous manipulation, piano playing, and more.

## Quickstart
To use Scaffolder, we need to install the Scaffolder algorithm and any environments we would like to run. Scaffolder builds on top of the DreamerV3 codebase, and expects the environments to follow the Gymnasium API. We expect the environment to return observation dictionaries, and specify through Scaffolder's configuration which observation keys are privileged or not.

After installating Scaffolder and environments, the folder structure should look like this:
```
projects/                   # Your project folder
  |- scaffolder/            # code for Scaffolder algorithm
  |- gymnasium_robotics/    # code for 7/10 S3 tasks
  |- gymnasium/             # code for Blind Locomotion task
  |- robopianist/           # code for Blind Deaf Piano task
  |- brachiation/           # code for Noisy Monkey task
```

#### 1. Create Conda environment.
Scaffolder runs on both Ubuntu and MacOS. I recommend installing it on MacOS for fast local development, and Ubuntu for actual GPU training. 
```zsh
conda create -n scaffolder python=3.8
```
Python 3.9 or later should also work, just that on my laptop it's 3.8. 

#### 2. Install Scaffolder algorithm

1. First, install jax following their [instructions](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

2. Then, clone Scaffolder's codebase, which extends DreamerV3. 
```zsh
git clone git@github.com:penn-pal-lab/scaffolder.git
# install dependencies.
pip install -r requirements.txt 
# install scaffolder as a local python package
pip install -e .
```
It's likely you will run into some versioning errors during installation of the packages in `requirements.txt` since they are not pinned to any versions. You can just overcome these by commenting out the troublesome packages in the file and manually install them with `pip install <your package>==<desired version>`.


#### 3. Install Sensory Scaffolding Suite 
The Sensory Scaffolding Suite (S3) is a collection of 10 tasks with predefined privileged and target observation spaces. The tasks are implemented via different repositories, so for a given task, you must install the corresponding repo. For users looking to just get started, I recommend just installing Gymnasium Robotics since that covers 7/10 tasks in S3.

| Repository | Task |
|---|---|
| Gymnasium Robotics | Blind Pick, Wrist Pick-Place, Occluded Pick-Place, Blind Numb Cube, Blind Numb Pen, RGB Cube, RGB Pen  |
| Gymnasium | Blind Locomotion |
| Robopianist | Blind Deaf Piano |
| Brachiation | Noisy Monkey |

<summary>Gymnasium Robotics Installation</summary>
Clone our custom fork of Gymnasium Robotics, change to the correct branch, and install dependencies.

```zsh
git clone git@github.com:edwhu/Gymnasium-Robotics.git
cd gymnasium_robotics
git checkout v0.1
pip install -e . # install this library as a local python package
```

### 4. Test installation
As a sanity check, let's see if the core Scaffolder training loop runs with very small networks and low dimensional state inputs. 
```zsh
python -u dreamerv3/train.py --logdir ~/logdir/test_blindpick_$(date "+%Y%m%d-%H%M%S") --configs gymnasium_blindpick,sanity_check
```
It should take a couple minutes to run. After it's done, we can check the tensorboard outputs.

```zsh
cd ~/logdir/
tensorboard --logdir . 
```
You should see some scalars and GIFs on tensorboard. This means the training loop is working, and the installation is successful.


## Running Experiments

In general, you need to specify the environment and the model size configurations.  You can override the configurations at the command line level as well. Below, we provide examples for running Scaffolder on each S3 task.
